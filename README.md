# Little-Virtual-Piano

This project is a virtual piano implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to allow users to play musical notes by clicking on the white and black keys on a simulated keyboard interface.

## Features

- **White and Black Keys:** Visual representation of a keyboard with white and black keys.
- **Sound Playback:** Clicking a key plays the corresponding musical note.
- **Interactivity:** Keys are shaded when pressed, providing visual feedback to the user.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for different screen sizes. (in progress)

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** Contains the basic structure of the keyboard in the DOM.
- **styles.css:** Contains styles for the layout and appearance of the keys and background.
- **app.js:** Handles the interaction logic, such as sound playback and key animation when pressed.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jessulina/your-repository.git
    ```
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.
3. Click on the piano keys to play musical notes.

## Future Improvements

- **Implement missing notes** for the black keys. (working on it...)
- **Optimize sound resources** for better performance. (i need to find better ones)
- **Add a game mode** where users can follow predefined melodies. (not yet but i would like to)
